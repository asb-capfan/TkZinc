Zinclib compilation and installation
====================================

If you want to use zinclib in your application, compile it and
read the 'README'


Compilation
-----------
A Makefile is provided for unix, macosX and mingw. A makefile.vc
is provided to compile with visual C++.
Before compiling zinclib, you need Tcl and Tk headers installed.
They must be in a standard include path (/usr/include).
All compilation is done into a tmp directory. Compilation produces
a zinclib.o file. This file can then be used in your application
as described into 'REAMDE'

To compile zinclib :
  make


Installation
------------
Installing zinclib consists in copying headers and object files into
the IntuiKit source hierarchy in order to use it in IntuiKit.

To install zinclib into Intuikit sources to use it as a library :
  make install


Tests
-----
Tests check that zinclib doesn't containy any know bug.
Tests consist in using zinclib to display items. There is not yet
any automated check. This means that tests will display their window
and closing them will go to next test.
Before compiling tests you need :

- tcl/tk >= 8.4
- TkZinc compiled for tcl usage and installed as done by IntuiKit's ThirdParty
- Tkimg compiled and installed on your system, see ThirdParty/README for more informations

To run tests :
  make test
