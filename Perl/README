Tk::Zinc - another Canvas which proposes many new functions, some based on openGL

Tk::Zinc for Perl/Tk is available for Linux, Windows and MacOSX. 
the easiest way could be to use he CPAN.
To build it you need:

* On a Linux system, you need Perl (>= 5.6) and perl-tk (800 or 804) as well as
  perl-tk developpement packages.

* On MacOSX you need:
  - fink with tk-pm package and its dependencies (http://fink.sf.net)
    tk-pm is available in unstable. You can add this binary unstable tree to you /sw/etc/apt/sources.list:
    deb http://fink.opendarwin.org/bbraun 10.3/unstable main crypto
    deb http://fink.opendarwin.org/bbraun 10.3/stable main crypto
  - X11 et X11 sdk from Apple (http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/)

* On WinXP you need:
  - activeperl (5.8.6.811 or higher) from activatestate.com 
  - and
    - if you want to compile TkZinc by yourself:
      Visual C++ or the Free Visual C++ Command Line Tools


Install:

  perl Makefile.PL
  # you can use the following options: --with-gl=yes|no --with-atc=yes|no --with-shape=yes|no
  # current defaults are  --with-gl=yes --with-atc=yes --with-shape=yes

  make
  make test

  # to run demos before installing:
  perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib demos/zinc-demos

  make install



WATCH OUT! On Linux it is quite frequent to have both Mesa and proprietary
           openGL libraries installed. This may lead to big problems at
           runtime if the linker picks the wrong library. It is often the
           the case between the static (libGL.a) Mesa library and the dynamic
           (libGL.so) NVidia library. It is very important to assert that
           the link is done with the library matching the openGL driver
           loaded in the X server.

In the case you need to use another version of perl-tk than the one installed in the 
system, you should use the following command as a template to adapt to follow your 
specific pathes of the alternative perl-tk installation:

  env PERL5LIB=/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi perl Makefile.PL
  make
  env PERL5LIB=/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi:/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi make test

  # to run demos before installing:
  env PERL5LIB=/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi:/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib demos/zinc-demos

  # and finally
  make install

  # and to run your script:
  env PERL5LIB=/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi:/usr/local/test/804_027/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/i386-linux-thread-multi perl <your_script.pl>




documentation is also available at https://github.com/asb-capfan/TkZinc
The source of the reference manual is available in the full source package,
which also includes TkZinc for Tcl/Tk, for Perl/Tk, and for Python.


After installation, we recommend you to launch the zinc-demos script,
a frontend to more than 30 small demos.

For more information on building Tk::Zinc, a README is available in 
the tkzinc-*tgz tar file (on Tkzinc web site) used for building all
flavor of TkZinc (ie tcl, perl and python)
