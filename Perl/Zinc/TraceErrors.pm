=head1 NAME

Tk::Zinc::TraceErrors - A module to trace all Tk::Zinc method calls which generate an error

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Tk::Zinc::TraceErrors;

or

perl -MTk::Zinc::TraceErrors YourZincBasedScript.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When loaded, this module overloads a Tk mechanism so that every
Tk::Zinc method call will be traced if it provokes an error. The execution
will then continue.

This module can be very effective for debugging and application, specially
when Tk gives an unusuable error message such as ".... errors in Tk.pm line 228"

=item * the source filename where the method has been invoked

=item * the TkZinc method name

=item * the list of arguments in a human-readable form

=item * the error message

This module cannot be used when Tk::Zinc::Trace is already in use.
