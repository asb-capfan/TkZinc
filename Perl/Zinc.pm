## used in curve or rectangle or an arc...

## a newer version of Zinc. HOWEVER YOU STILL MUST CHANGE THE CODE OF THIS OLD APPICATION

## Remember: the incompatible change in Zinc is due to the introduction of

=head1 NAME

Tk::Zinc - TkZinc is another Canvas which proposes many new functions, some based on openGL

=for category Tk Widget Classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<$zinc> = I<$parent>-E<gt>B<Zinc>(?I<options>?);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Zinc> widget is very similar to Tk Canvase in that it supports
structured graphics. Like the Canvas, TkZinc implements items used to
display graphical entities. Those items can be manipulated and bindings can be
associated with them to implement interaction behaviors. But unlike the
Canvas, TkZinc can structure the items in a hierarchy (with the use of
group items), has support for affine 2D transforms (i.e. translation, scaling, and
rotation), clipping can be set for sub-trees of the item hierarchy, the item set
is quite more powerful including field specific items for Air Traffic systems and
new rendering techniques such as transparency and gradients.

Since the 3.2.2 version, TkZinc also offers as a runtime option, the support
for openGL rendering, giving access to features such as antialiasing, transparency,
color gradients and even a new, openGL oriented, item type triangles.

TkZinc full documentation is available as part of the Zinc software as a
pdf file, B<refman.pdf> and html pages B<refman/index.html>.

As a complement to the reference manual, small Perl/Tk demos of TkZinc are
also available through a small application named zinc-demos, highly inspired
from the widget application included in Tk. The aim of these demos are both
to demonstrates the power of TkZinc and to help newcomers start using
TkZinc with small examples.

=head1 WHERE CAN I FIND TkZinc?

TkZinc is available as source in tar.gz format or as Debian or RedHat/Mandrake
packages at http://www.tkzinc.org/ or http://freshmeat.net/projects/zincisnotcanvas/

TkZinc is also available on CPAN since v3.294 (a kind of 3.2.94)
